# Samurai - Pico 8 game

 Samurai is a small Pico-8 game I made in a weekend to test out the Pico-8 software.

I had a lot of fun making a game in this software, as it provided a feel for what it might be like to create a game on hardware like the NES. The aim of the game is to knock your opponent off the ledge by quickly parrying their attacks and dashing in for your own strike when they're off balance!
