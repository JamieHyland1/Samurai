# Samurai - Pico 8 game
    samurai is a small pico 8 game I made in a weekend to test out the small and intestesting software Pico-8! Had a lot of run making a game in this software as it was quite bare bones and gave me a feel of what it might be like to make a game on an NES or similar hardware.

I've added the game file if you wanted to download the game and import it into pico-8 so you can modify it and play it :D enjoy!
